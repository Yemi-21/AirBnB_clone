Welcome to the AirBnB clone project

The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. It won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.



First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This first step is very important because it will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end in



What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:



Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

Update attributes of an object

Destroy an object

Execution

Your could work like this in interactive mode:



$ ./console.py

(hbnb) help



Documented commands (type help <topic>):

========================================

EOF  help  quit



(hbnb) 

(hbnb) 

(hbnb) quit

$

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)



$ echo "help" | ./console.py

(hbnb)



Documented commands (type help <topic>):

========================================

EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 

$

$ cat test_help

help

$

$ cat test_help | ./console.py

(hbnb)



Documented commands (type help <topic>):

========================================

EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 

$
